Core Requirements
Technical Stack

Python 3.8+ as your primary language
Vector Database: Choose between:

ChromaDB (easiest to start with)
Qdrant (good performance, runs locally)
Weaviate (more features but complex)


Embeddings Model:

OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 (if you're okay with API calls)
Sentence-transformers (for fully local: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is a good start)


LLM:

OpenAI API (easier but requires API key)
Local options: Llama 2, Mistral 7B, or Phi-2 via Ollama


Document Processing: LangChain or LlamaIndex for document loading and chunking

Hardware Requirements

At least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended for local LLMs)
10-20GB storage for models and vector DB
GPU helpful but not required for small models

Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
1. Start Simple (Week 1)
python# Basic structure
- Set up ChromaDB locally
- Load a few PDFs using LangChain
- Create embeddings for chunks
- Implement basic similarity search
2. Build Core RAG Pipeline (Week 2)

Document ingestion system (PDFs, Word docs, markdown)
Smart text chunking (preserve context)
Embedding generation and storage
Basic retrieval function
Simple query interface (CLI first)

3. Add Intelligence (Week 3)

Implement reranking of retrieved chunks
Add metadata filtering (date, source, type)
Hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
Context window management

4. Improve UX (Week 4)

Web interface using Gradio or Streamlit
Citation tracking (show source documents)
Conversation memory
Export capabilities

Key Challenges to Plan For

Chunking Strategy: Documents need to be split intelligently. Start with fixed-size chunks with overlap, then experiment with semantic chunking.
Retrieval Quality: Initial results might be poor. Plan to implement:

Hybrid search (BM25 + vector similarity)
Reranking with cross-encoders
Query expansion


Context Management: LLMs have token limits. You'll need strategies for:

Selecting most relevant chunks
Summarizing long contexts
Maintaining conversation history


Document Parsing: Different formats need different approaches:

PDFs can be tricky (try PyPDF2, pdfplumber)
Consider OCR for scanned documents
Handle tables and images separately

First Week Goals

Set up environment with ChromaDB and sentence-transformers
Successfully index 10 documents
Implement basic semantic search that returns relevant chunks
Create a simple CLI that takes questions and returns answers with sources

Advanced Features to Consider Later

Multi-modal support (images, charts)
Incremental indexing for new documents
User-specific document permissions
Query analytics and improvement
Fine-tuning embeddings on your domain
Automated document updates and versioning

Would you like me to provide specific code examples for any of these components, or help you decide between local vs. API-based approaches for the LLM and embeddings?
